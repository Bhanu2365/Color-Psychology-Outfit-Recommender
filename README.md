🎨 Color Psychology Outfit Recommender
A simple, single-page Python application that suggests outfit colors based on your current mood using principles of color psychology.

📌 Project Overview
Color Psychology Outfit Recommender is a command-line tool that helps users choose clothing colors that align with how they feel. It maps moods like happy, stressed, or energetic to color suggestions and corresponding outfit ideas using psychological associations with color.

💡 How It Works
The user is prompted to enter their current mood.

The application matches the mood with a predefined color based on color psychology.

A suggested outfit is displayed using that color.

If the mood input is unrecognized, the user is notified and asked to try again.

Happy	Yellow	Yellow sundress or yellow t-shirt
Stressed	Blue	Blue cardigan or blue jeans
Energetic	Red	Red sportswear or red sneakers
